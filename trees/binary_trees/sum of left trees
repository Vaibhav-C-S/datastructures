Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of all left leaves.

A leaf is a node with no children. A left leaf is a leaf that is the left child of another node.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 24
Explanation: There are two left leaves in the binary tree, with values 9 and 15 respectively.
Example 2:

Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000







class Solution(object):
    
    def sumOfLeftLeaves(self, root):
        self.sum =0
        def sumval(root,isLeft):
            if root is None:
                return 0
            else:
                if root.left is None and root.right is None and isLeft:
                    self.sum += root.val
                sumval(root.left,isLeft=True)
                sumval(root.right,isLeft=False)
            return self.sum
        return sumval(root,False)
