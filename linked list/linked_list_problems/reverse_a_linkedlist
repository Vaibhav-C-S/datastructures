how to reverse a linked list


    def reverse(self):
        temp = self.head
        self.head = self.tail
        self.tail = temp
        before = temp.next.next
        after = temp.next
        while temp is not None:
            after = temp.next
            temp.next = before
            before = temp
            temp = after
  
  NOTE:
  we can return before at the end,to get the last node,might be useful for palindrome
